# Darkside_New
This is the shadow-side version of Sunder. Sunder itself is open source and designed for Aetolia, though it could likely be implemented for any IRE MUD.

This GitHub was started to make it easier for people to contribute updates that they feel will help the system, be that in optimization or otherwise.

If you have any questions, you can join us in Discord: https://discord.gg/ZsbZUTp

We're in need of contributors! Please feel free to fork and make PRs! If you want to contribute but aren't sure how, get ahold of Delra in the Discord. They're always happy to help you help this project move forward. 

There is *no* warranty on this software.
